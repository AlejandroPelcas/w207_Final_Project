The ministers sought a new commission for breaking down doors.  They appointed Alexander Colville, justice depute, as prosecutor.

They were first brought before the Kirk session and made to confess and then turned over to the civil magistrate.  The court claimed they were forced to confess through 'exceeding torture'.  They tied their 'thumbs behind them' and hanged them by them, they were whipped by two Highlanders, and had lighted candles put to the soles of their feet, between their toes and in their mouths.  Six were accused and four died from the torture.  Another suspect was kept 20 days on bread and water after being stripped naked and laid on a cold stone with only a hair-cloth.  Others had hair-shirts dipped in vinegar to 'fetch off their skin'.",LEM,08/08/02 10:07:26,LEM,10/07/02 15:06:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
